# Intro to Javascript

We've started covering some javascript, let's test some of what we've covered.

## Deliverables
Submit an MVC application that includes only a Home/Index action which contains a `<script>` tag on the view containing all of the required javascript by the instructions below. Push to a repository on github and submit your link.

## Normal Mode
Just like we do in Python, do these in javascript

* Assign "Hello World" to a variable message
* Assign a different string to a different variable
* Assign a number to a variable
* Use string interpolation'ish to display the number in a string
* Make an array of your favorite movies or books or bands. Have at least 4 values.
* push new items into the above array, minimum of 3.
* Iterate through each item in your array and output that individual item to the screen.
* Turn a sentence into an Array, find the words that are six characters long and output them to the console. Here's your sentence: var sentence = "Schlitz four dollar toast godard truffaut bespoke neutra artisan pop-up. Chia keytar single-origin coffee sustainable disrupt.";
