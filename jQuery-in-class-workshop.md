# jQuery in-class workshop

## Basic challenge

Create a page that displays a number and has two buttons. One button increments the number and the other decrements the number. The number cannot be changed manually and starts at zero.

## Advanced challenge

Anytime the number is EVEN, change the color to RED. If it is ODD, leave it BLACK

## Expert challenge

Anytime the number contains the digit '2', display the number in italics.

## Pro challenge

Every time the buttons are clicked, instead of changing by one, get a random number each time and either add or subtract the random number. See if you can get the number back to zero.
